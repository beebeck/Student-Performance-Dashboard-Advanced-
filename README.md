# Student-Performance-Dashboard-Advanced-
Why this?

The intention to update the previously made dashboard is to implement the advance feature that Powerbi provides to its user. I have implemented the search slicer interms of department and Student so its easy to track the record through. Along with this, i have even implemented  CARD to reflect the rate of performance and data descriptions.

Findings:
